ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science Datasets Collection

This collection includes all the datasets produced and published by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (ARCCSS) during its existence (2011-2018), with the exclusion of datasets which are part of cooperation projects (for example CMIP5 experiments). 
The focus of the centre, Climate System Science, is the quantitative study of the climate system designed to enable modeling of the future of the climate system. It is built on a core of the sciences of the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and land surface. It includes the physics, dynamics and biology of these systems, and the flow of energy, water and chemicals between them. Climate System Science builds mathematical models of these systems based on observations. It describes these observations, and the underlying physics of the system, in computer codes. These computer codes are known as a climate model and utilize very large super computers.
